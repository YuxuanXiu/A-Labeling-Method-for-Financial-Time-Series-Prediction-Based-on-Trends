# A Labeling Method for Financial Time Series Prediction Based on Trends

This is a non-official implementation of the trend labeling method proposed in the paper [A Labeling Method for Financial Time Series Prediction Based on Trends](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/22/10/1162).

In this method, the trend is labeled based on a certain parameter *w*. Once the price rises by more than *w* from the local
trough, it is regarded as an uptrend, and the local trough is labeled as the beginning of the uptrend. Meanwhile, when the price falls by more than *w* from the local peak, this method labels a downtrend starting from the local peak.

## Examples

The following three figures show the labeling results for the CSI 300 price time series with *w*=10%, 15%, and 20%, respectively.

## Setup

To run this example you need the following packages:
```
pip install numpy tqdm akshare matplotlib
```
